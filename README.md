Hi! I'm Alessandro, a PhD student in Computer Science at University of Pisa! <br/>

In 2012, not yet started university, I stumbled by chance in a divulgative book about computer science and, in the very last pages, I read about these two words:
"Quantum Computing" <br/>

From that day, my curiosity about this field has grown every day and today, I'm so happy that this fascinating field is the focus of my PhD.

In 2019, he and his friends launched a podcast, the [PointerPodcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/3XmDzcZv4rCIx1VpWrbrkh), a italian podcast which focuses on the topic of technology and innovation.
