Hi! I'm Alessandro, a PhD student in Computer Science at University of Pisa! <br/>

In 2012, not yet started university, I stumbled by chance in a divulgative book about computer science and, in the very last pages, I read about these two words:
"Quantum Computing" <br/>

From that day, my curiosity about this field have grown every day and today, I'm so happy that this fascinating field is the focus of my PhD.
